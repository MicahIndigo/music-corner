## About

Music Corner is a music-focused blog and discussion platform, where users can post music-related news, write blog style updates, leave comments and interact with content.

Music corner aims to build a friendly, community-driven space where music lovers can discuss the latest releases, industry news and trending topics.

This project is built using **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with deployment managed through **Render**.

## Rationale

The goal of this project is to create a clean, blogging platform with social interaction features, focusing specifically on music news and culture.

Django is ideal for managing user-generated content, while PostgreSQL ensures good relational data handling.

The platform is built to be expanddable, with future features such as profiles, playlists and chat/communities to be added later.
